# Automate creating your ReactJs components

This script is built for personal use when I got frustrated creating components manually and was all the same work I had to do, I came across this sample script to boost my productivity creating ReactJs component through the shell script by one single command with the code snippet along with the scss file too.

## New features need to be added
It works fine until now for me even if I try to create a nested component, at the moment I'm configured for `TypeScript` only. and hope to add `Javascript`, `CSS` as well. perhaps stop overwriting component
